Machine learning models offer  a promising solution by leveraging  advanced algorithms to analyze large  datasets and identify hidden patterns.  By incorporating various  meteorological parameters, such as  temperature, humidity, and wind  speed, machine learning can provide  more accurate and timely rainfall  predictions.
Machine learning techniques, like Random Forests,  Ridge Regressor,
K Neighbors Regressor have shown  great potential in enhancing rainfall  prediction. These models can handle  nonlinear relationships and capture  complex interactions between  meteorological variables. By training on  historical data, machine learning  algorithms can learn patterns and  make predictions with higher accuracy.  Additionally, ensemble methods can  combine multiple models to further  improve prediction performance.
